# README

Messaging app made as part of a Ruby on Rails Udemy Course. I do not recommend the course, as noted elsewhere. 

In the course this was built with Semantic UI; however, I ran into issues installing a dependent gem (sassc) and the solution that worked for many others (uninstalling and reinstalling ruby) did not work for me. As a result I won't be using it. 

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...
